<h3>Page 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wrote DOCTYPE html on the very top to clarify the format of the document.</li>
    <li>Also wrote lang="en" to clarify that the document is written in english.</li>
    <li>Fixed em tag to add emphasis on the cr√®me fraiche in the body of the article. Fixed it by Changing the closing tag from e to /sem</li>
    <li>Changed the order of the headers (changd the h3 to an h2) to keep the hierarchy of the page consistent.</li>
    <li>Added closing html tag to the bottom of the doc to close it all off corectly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Page 2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wrote DOCTYPE html on the very top to clarify the format of the document.</li>
    <li>Fixed the h2 element that was surrounded by B (b-h2-h2-b) to have b inside h2 element where it is allowed to be.</li>
    <li>Changed all of the headings to be consistent h3 instead of having different values for each one.  </li>
    <li>Spaces are not allowed in links so I changed, where do i go, to where_do_i_go in the href.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Page 3</h3>
<ul>
    <li>List element was missing an i. (l instead of li), I changed it to have a correct opening and closing tag.</li>
    <li>The table had an empty closing tag for td. I closed it and added the proper format  / td </li>
    <li> Table was very misorganised. The rows were messed up and didn't display the names correctly in order. I changed the order to have each of the names display in row with each other. Including Lily and Olatunkbo's and axelias. </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Page 4</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Doctype was missing at the top of the code. I added the proper starting line to the top.</li>
    <li> All images missing alternative attribute. This is not good because it hinders the accessibility of the page. I added alt description to all.</li>
    <li> Orange cat and alien photo did not have t-d attributes, which puts them in a column. I added one to each so they could fit in the table.  </li>
    <li>Images in table did not line up with their category. I reorganized the table so it makes sense relativly to the table headers. </li>
</ul>
